# Notifications Page Challenge

This is my solution to the Frontend Mentor **notifications page** challenge.

## What I Did
-  Built responsive notifications page built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** practiced how to handle unread states and DOM updates.

- Users can:
  - See which notifications are unread
  - Click **"Mark all as read"** to clear unread notifications
  - See the number of unread notifications
  - Get responsive layout for mobile and desktop
  - Interact with hover and focus effects

## Tools Used

- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox & Media Queries)
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Getting Started

Just open the `index.html` file in your browser to see it in action.
